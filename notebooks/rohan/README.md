Today I spent the entire day on development since we've finally received many of the parts required for our user interface subsystem. My goal was to understand how to use the RFID reader module and LCD. To effectively learn how each of these parts worked before integrating them into the system, I first tested each module on my Arduino Uno using the manufacturer-provided test files and libraries. Once each of these was working individually, my objective for the day was to be able to read an RFID's unique ID (UID) using the Arduino and then echo it to the LCD. 

First, I found this [tutorial](https://learn.sunfounder.com/lesson-1-display-by-i2c-lcd1602/) on the SunFounder website to learn how to display text to the LCD. Similarly, I used this [guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/security-access-using-mfrc522-rfid-reader-with-arduino/) to setup & wire the RFID reader using my Arduino. Once those were setup, I was able to use the following code to get the RFID to print its UID to the serial monitor.

Our project initially proposed using iCards as the RFID tags to allow authentication into the system. However, I unfortuntely realized that the RFID reader we had ordered is not compatible with iCards, as only the provided test RFID tags were being read. I ended up looking into [types of RFID](https://www.atlasrfidstore.com/rfid-insider/low-frequency-rfid-vs-high-frequency-rfid/) and realized that there are two primary forms, high and low frequency readers and tags. The high frequency reader that we had ordered is more common in amateur or hobbyist settings, while low frequency ones are used in professional settings, like in iCards. However, buying a low frequency reader wouldn't be enough to solve this issue either - after some further investigation from this [forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/xr02mi/hid_seos_cards_returning_random_values_from_a/), I found that the iCard manufactuer, HID, restricts its cards to only be read by its HID brand. Even if I had a high frequency RFID reader, unless it was an HID one, the UID read from each iCard would be different each time as part of the company's encryption process. HID readers were all over $150, so I decided to talk to Sanjana and the course staff about the issue. 

By the end of the day, on the Arduino, I was able to get software running to extract the UID from an RFID tag and display that UID on the LCD, a significant component of our user interface subsystem.
