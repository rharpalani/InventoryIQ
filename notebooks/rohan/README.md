Today I spent the entire day on development since we've finally received many of the parts required for our user interface subsystem. My goal was to understand how to use the RFID reader module and LCD. To effectively learn how each of these parts worked before integrating them into the system, I first tested each module on my Arduino Uno using the manufacturer-provided test files and libraries. Once each of these was working individually, my objective for the day was to be able to read an RFID's unique ID (UID) using the Arduino and then echo it to the LCD. 

First, I found this [tutorial](https://learn.sunfounder.com/lesson-1-display-by-i2c-lcd1602/) on the SunFounder website
